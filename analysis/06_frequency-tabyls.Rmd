## Introduction

Whenever a data analysts gets the data to work with, they will need to do a lot of counting 
as a first interaction with it, to understand it and interpret it.

![The Data Science Lifecycle](here::here("docs","assets","data-science-explore.png"))

It is an important of the exploratory stage in data analysis.  This is where we create early 
graphs (histograms, bar charts, etc.), create summaries and the like, to make sense of the date or 
create early hypothesis from it.

One of the quick ways to see distribution of the data is using frequency tables.  
Base R has the `table()` function for that.  `janitor` using `tabyl()`, makes this job 
way more visual and representative.
